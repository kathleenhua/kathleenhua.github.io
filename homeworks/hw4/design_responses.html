						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>"To meet the W3C's minimum AA rating, the background to text contrast ratio should be 4.5:1. 
								I also learned that you can use patterns/textures to improve accessibility in the website.
								It was really interesting to me that there were regulations surrounding website accessibility, 
								but it's good that it is already implemented." </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>"My favorite part was (once again) the images that helped support the points being made in the article.
								It was helpful to have a visual aid in what the article was describing. For example, the sample messaging/iconography to relay system information
								and pattern implementation helped me understand what the author of the article was describing.." </p>
