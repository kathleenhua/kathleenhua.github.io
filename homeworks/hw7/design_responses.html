							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>Gestalt Principles in UI design basically means that our brains function in small ways that can be put together to guide our design.
								I learned that our brains automatically complete incomplete objects which we can use to minimalize graphics or icons. Complexity and noise would be reduced as a result of the "Closure principle".</p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
