<h3>Article Question Responses</h6>
<ul>
    <li>I learned that one of the best ways to learn design is by observation. The article breaks down several popular apps and emphasizes the purpose and user needs and how it is reflected in the design of the app.</li>
    <li>My favorite part of the article were the gifs that helped illustrate the pieces of the app design coming together. I appreciated how the author of the article included explanations and thoughts that helped direct my attention to details I may have not noticed myself. The gifs also help you break down the design elements individually as they appeared.</li>
    <li>"The time stamp includes not just the date, but also the specific time. Why might that be the case? Also, notice where the timestamp is shortened elsewhere in the app (e.g. “5h” on Feed view or “4/14/18” on Profile view). Think through the different intentions of those views."</li>
    <li>I'd say I rank the article a 7. It was concise, was clear, and I now have a new "activity" I can do while waiting in lines.</li>
