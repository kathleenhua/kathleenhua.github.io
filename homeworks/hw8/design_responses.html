					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>I learned that there are 11 types of dark patterns. Specifically, Privacy Zuckering is tricking the user into sharing more information than they intended.
							Almost all companies have tricks to confuse users into giving away more information, such as Terms of Service that are hard to understand because of the "legal jargon".
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>I liked how the article included detailed explanations for each of the 11 types of dark patterns. I also appreciated the Manipulation Matrix visualizer that helped visualize decisions made by the innovate/designer.
							I also liked how the article acknowledged that the designer's moral compass also comes into the decision making of whether to use dark patterns.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "We help shape the lives of people everywhere and our decisions can have significant impacts on the way we as a society behave. Giving in to dark patterns for meeting short-term goals is not the solution." </p>
					</li>
