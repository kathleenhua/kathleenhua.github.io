                            <p>I learned of some ways to incorporate animations into a website. I think I've always 
                                envisioned animations being cartoony but it was cool to see moving people/real things moving.
                                I also learned how animations can really spice up a website and enhance its quality.</p>

                            <p>I liked how this week it was literally just gifs of website/design inspiration. It brings to mind other designs that
                                I liked and has sparked some inspiration within me. I like how there's a lot of variety between designs as well. </p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>I liked the easygrow.io app interface. It reminded me a lot of Philz's app which in my opinion
                                is really nice design because of its mix of photos and design elements. I liked how the colors matched the images and how clean it is. The information displayed on the 
                                app is easy to read and it has a unique style made by the typography and consistent design. </p>
